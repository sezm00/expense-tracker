Great! With two days free, you have a solid window to build a **small but impressive project** that can boost your portfolio and help you learn. Here's a project tailored to your experience (Python, Java, MERN stack, UI design, database knowledge, etc.):

## üöÄ Project: **AI-Powered Expense Tracker**

### üí° Idea:

Create a simple web app that tracks daily expenses, categorizes them automatically using a basic AI model (or rules), and shows spending analytics.

---

### üß∞ Tech Stack Options:

* **Frontend**: React (with Tailwind CSS or Material UI)
* **Backend**: Node.js + Express or Python Flask
* **Database**: MongoDB (or SQLite if using Python)
* **AI Component**: Simple keyword-based categorizer or use OpenAI API (if available)

---

### üóÇÔ∏è Features:

1. **Add Expense**:

   * Description, Amount, Date
   * Auto-categorization (Food, Travel, Bills, etc.)

2. **View History**:

   * Filter by date/category
   * Sort by amount/date

3. **Analytics Page**:

   * Pie chart (spending by category)
   * Line chart (spending over time)

4. **Export to CSV** (optional)

---

### üî• Stretch Goals:

* Authentication (Google OAuth or simple login)
* Mobile responsiveness
* Dark mode toggle

---

### ‚è±Ô∏è Suggested Timeline:

**Day 1:**

* Set up project (frontend & backend scaffold)
* Build expense entry + display UI
* Set up backend API + DB
* Implement basic categorization logic

**Day 2:**

* Add analytics (charts)
* Polish UI
* Optional features (auth/export)
* Test + deploy on Render/Netlify/Vercel

---

### üì¶ Resources:

* [Chart.js with React](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)
* [Tailwind UI components](https://tailwindui.com/)
* [MongoDB Atlas free cluster](https://www.mongodb.com/atlas/database)

Would you like me to generate a starter boilerplate for you (React + Node or Flask)? Or modify the idea based on a specific tech stack you want to practice more?
